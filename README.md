3. _(Optional) If you forgot to clone recursively, run this command at the root folder:_
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
4. Run the install script:
```sh
./install.sh
```
1. Go inside the `lib/finary_api` folder and follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/lasconic/finary#quick-start) summarized here:
```sh
cd lib/finary_api                         # Go to 
cp credentials.json.tpl credentials.json  # Use the template to create credentials.json
nano credentials.json                     # <- Enter your Finary account credentials
python -m finary_api signin               # Sign in and make sure everything works

```
6. Run the assistant with `python assistant.py`.
<!-- ```sh
python assistant.py
``` -->

And you're done! You should see a template portfolio tree and your investments detected from Finary. Now go customize the `assistant.py` file for your own needs üöÄ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage 
The goal is to declare a tree structure of your entire portfolio investments independently from their host envelopes (e.g. PEA, AV, CTO, etc). Define your own asset-based global strategy without feeling constrainted by keeping similar assets in common envelopes. Once your entire portfolio strategy is defined here, find the best envelope for each line and add them to your Finary account (manual or automatic sync). Assistant will fetch each line and display your full portfolio with real-time amounts.

To create your portfolio, start with a `Portfolio` object which holds a nested list of `Line`, `Folder`, and `SharedFolder` objects:
- `Line` represents each individual investment. Set the `key` parameter as the name shown in your Finary account if different from the display name.
- `Folder` holds a group of lines or subfolders to create a structure.
- `SharedFolder` accepts a `Bucket` object which groups multiple lines as a single object. You can reference the same bucket multiple times in the tree and set different `bucket_amount` for each shared folder. Each folder will only take the provided amount and let others use the rest.

Finally, any object in the structure accepts an optional `Target`. See the implementation guidelines below.

#### Example

Here is an example of a portfolio structure:
```python
# Create a list of Lines that will be considered as a single Line.
my_bucket = Bucket([
  Line('My Asset 1', key='name_in_finary'),
  Line('My Asset 2', key='name_in_finary'),
  # ...
])

# Define your entire portfolio structure
portfolio = Portfolio('My Portfolio', children=[
  # Add a list of `Line`, `Folder`, and `SharedFolder` objects
  Folder('Short term', children=[
    Line('My Asset 3', key='name_in_finary'),
    SharedFolder('My Folder', bucket=my_bucket, bucket_amount=1000),
    # ...
  ]),
  Folder('Long term', children=[
    Folder('Stocks', children=[
      SharedFolder('My Folder', bucket=my_bucket), # display what's left in the bucket
      # ...
    ]),
    # ...
  ])
])
```

#### Targets
Any node in the tree accepts an optional `target` parameter. See the full list of available targets [here](./finary_assistant/portfolio/targets.py). Here is an example:

```python
Folder('Stocks', target=TargetMin(2000, tolerance=500), children=[
  Line('ETF World', key='Amundi ETF ...', target=TargetRatio(80, tolerance=5)), 
  # ... Other lines with the remaining 20% of the Stocks folder.
])
```
