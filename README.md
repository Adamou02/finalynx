## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage 
The goal is to declare a tree structure of your entire portfolio investments independently from their host envelopes (e.g. PEA, AV, CTO, etc). Define your own asset-based global strategy without feeling constrainted on keeping similar assets in common envelopes. Once your entire portfolio strategy is defined here, find the best envelope for each line and add your envelopes to your Finary account (manual or automatic sync). This project will fetch each line amount from Finary and display your full portfolio with real-time amounts.

To declare your portfolio, create a nested list of `Folder` objects as your structure. Each folder can hold multiple `Line` objects, one for each of your investments. You can define `Target` amounts at each structure level.

#### Example

Here is an example of a portfolio structure:
```python
# Create a list of Lines that will be considered as a single Line.
my_bucket = Bucket([
  Line('My Asset 1', key='name_in_finary'),
  Line('My Asset 2', key='name_in_finary'),
  # ...
])

# Define your entire portfolio structure
portfolio = Portfolio('My Portfolio', children=[
  # Add a list of `Line`, `Folder`, and `SharedFolder` objects
  Folder('Short term', children=[
    Line('My Asset 3', key='name_in_finary'),
    Folder('Stocks', children=[
      # ...
    ]),
    # ...
  ]),
  Folder('Long term', children=[
    SharedFolder('My Folder', bucket=my_bucket, bucket_amount=1000),
    # ...
  ])
])
```

#### Buckets & Shared Folders
Hey

#### Targets
Any node in the tree accepts an optional `target` parameter. Here is an example:

```python
Folder('Stocks', target=TargetMin(2000, tolerance=500), children=[
  Line('ETF World', key='Amundi ETF ...', target=TargetRange(80, tolerance=5)), 
  # ... Other lines with the remaining 20% of the Stocks folder.
])
```
